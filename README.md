# Swift & C++ interoperability: Custom libc++ sample

This is a sample that demonstrates to how use
custom libc++, to build a Swift module that depends on
the some C++ headers that use custom libc++, and to
use throughout the rest of the Swift program.

This sample is geared up for x64 windows, as it includes
a distribution of libc++ for that platform, but it should
work just as well on other platforms too.

(More to come...)
